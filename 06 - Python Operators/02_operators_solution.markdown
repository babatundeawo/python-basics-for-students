## Solution Code

```python
# operators.py
# This program demonstrates arithmetic, comparison, logical, and membership operators

"""
Program: Operator Explorer
Author: [Your Name]
Purpose: Demonstrates the use of arithmetic, comparison, logical, and membership operators in Python
"""

# Declare variables
a = 15  # Integer for first number
b = 4   # Integer for second number
text = "Python Programming"  # String for text

# Perform and print arithmetic operations
print("Sum:", a + b)  # Addition
print("Floor Division:", a // b)  # Floor division

## Explanation

### Objective
The exercise requires creating a Python program (`operators.py`) that:
- Declares variables: `a` (integer), `b` (integer), and `text` (string).
- Performs and prints:
  - Arithmetic operations: `a + b`, `a // b`, `a % b`.
  - Comparison operations: `a > b`, `a == b * 4`.
  - Logical operation: `a > 10 and b < 5`.
  - Membership operation: `"Python" in text`.
- Includes comments to explain each operation.
- Runs correctly with `python operators.py`.

### Line-by-Line Breakdown
Let’s walk through the code to understand each part, its input, output, and purpose:

1. **File Creation**:
   - The code is saved in a file named `operators.py`. This ensures Python recognizes it as a Python script when you run `python operators.py`.

2. **Single-Line Comment**:
   ```python
   # operators.py
   # This program demonstrates arithmetic, comparison, logical, and membership operators
   ```
   - **Purpose**: These comments, marked with `#`, describe the file and program purpose. They are ignored by Python but help readers understand the code.
   - **Input**: None.
   - **Output**: None (comments don’t produce output).
   - **Side Effects**: None.

3. **Multiline Comment**:
   ```python
   """
   Program: Operator Explorer
   Author: [Your Name]
   Purpose: Demonstrates the use of arithmetic, comparison, logical, and membership operators in Python
   """
   ```
   - **Purpose**: A multiline comment using triple quotes (`"""`) provides detailed documentation, including the program’s name, author, and purpose. Since it’s not assigned to a variable, Python ignores it.
   - **Input**: None.
   - **Output**: None.
   - **Side Effects**: None.

4. **Variable Declarations**:
   ```python
   a = 15  # Integer for first number
   b = 4   # Integer for second number
   text = "Python Programming"  # String for text
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Creates three variables:
     - `a`: Stores integer `15`. **Input**: `15`. **Output**: None. **Side Effects**: `a` holds `15`.
     - `b`: Stores integer `4`. **Input**: `4`. **Output**: None. **Side Effects**: `b` holds `4`.
     - `text`: Stores string `"Python Programming"`. **Input**: `"Python Programming"`. **Output**: None. **Side Effects**: `text` holds `"Python Programming"`.
   - **Comment**: Inline comments explain each variable’s purpose.

5. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   ```python
   print("Sum:", a + b)  # Addition
   print("Floor Division:", a // b)  # Floor division
   print("Modulus:", a % b)  # Modulus
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Performs arithmetic operations and prints results.
   - **Line-by-Line**:
     - `a + b`: Adds `15 + 4`. **Input**: `a`, `b`. **Output**: `Sum: 19`.
     - `a // b`: Floor division of `15 / 4`, rounds down to nearest integer. **Output**: `Floor Division: 3`.
     - `a % b`: Remainder of `15 / 4`. **Output**: `Modulus: 3`.
   - **Side Effects**: Only printing to the terminal.

6. **Comparison Operations**:
   ```python
   print("Is a > b?", a > b)  # Greater than
   print("Is a equal to b * 4?", a == b * 4)  # Equality with multiplication
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Performs comparison operations.
   - **Line-by-Line**:
     - `a > b`: Checks if `15 > 4`. **Output**: `Is a > b? True`.
     - `a == b * 4`: Checks if `15 == 4 * 4` (i.e., `15 == 16`). **Output**: `Is a equal to b * 4? False`.
   - **Note**: Multiplication (`b * 4`) is evaluated first due to operator precedence.

7. **Logical Operation**:
   ```python
   print("Is a > 10 and b < 5?", a > 10 and b < 5)  # Logical AND
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Combines two conditions with `and`.
   - **Explanation**: Checks if `15 > 10` (True) and `4 < 5` (True). Since both are True, `and` returns True. **Output**: `Is a > 10 and b < 5? True`.

8. **Membership Operation**:
   ```python
   print("Is 'Python' in text?", "Python" in text)  # Membership test
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Tests if `"Python"` is a substring of `text`.
   - **Explanation**: Since `"Python"` is in `"Python Programming"`, returns True. **Output**: `Is 'Python' in text? True`.

### Visual Description
When you run `python operators.py` in the terminal, the output is:
```
Sum: 19
Floor Division: 3
Modulus: 3
Is a > b? True
Is a equal to b * 4? False
Is a > 10 and b < 5? True
Is 'Python' in text? True
```
Each line shows the result of an operation, with descriptive labels and values or booleans.

### Common Mistakes and Fixes
1. **Division by Zero**:
   - **Mistake**:
     ```python
     print(a / 0)  # Division by zero
     ```
   - **Error**: `ZeroDivisionError`.
   - **Fix**: Ensure `b` is non-zero, e.g., `b = 4`.
2. **Using `=` Instead of `==`**:
   - **Mistake**:
     ```python
     print(a = b * 4)  # Assigns instead of compares
     ```
   - **Error**: Assigns `b * 4` to `a`, causing unexpected behavior.
   - **Fix**: Use `a == b * 4` for comparison.
3. **Incorrect Precedence**:
   - **Mistake**:
     ```python
     print(a == b * 4)  # Misinterpreting as (a == b) * 4
     ```
   - **Fix**: Understand that `*` has higher precedence than `==`. Use parentheses if needed, e.g., `(a == b) * 4`.
4. **Using `in` with Non-Sequences**:
   - **Mistake**:
     ```python
     print(5 in a)  # a is an integer, not a sequence
     ```
   - **Error**: `TypeError`.
   - **Fix**: Use `in` with sequences like `text` or lists.
5. **Wrong File Extension**:
   - **Mistake**: Saving as `operators.txt`.
   - **Fix**: Save as `operators.py` and run with `python operators.py`.

### Validation Check
To confirm the program works:
1. Save the code in `operators.py`.
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the file’s directory, and run `python operators.py`.
3. Verify the output matches: `Sum: 19`, `Floor Division: 3`, `Modulus: 3`, `Is a > b? True`, `Is a equal to b * 4? False`, `Is a > 10 and b < 5? True`, `Is 'Python' in text? True`.
4. Test with different values (e.g., `a = 20`, `b = 5`, `text = "Code Python"`) to ensure flexibility.
5. Add `print(type(a + b))` to confirm the sum is an integer (`<class 'int'>`).

### One-Line Takeaway
This program demonstrates arithmetic (`+`, `//`, `%`), comparison (`>`, `==`), logical (`and`), and membership (`in`) operators in Python with clear output formatting.
