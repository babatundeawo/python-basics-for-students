# Solution to the Weekly Project: Simple Budget Checker

## Explanation

The weekly project involves creating a Python program to help manage a weekly shopping budget. The program calculates the total cost of three items, checks if the total is within a given budget, and determines if there’s enough money left to afford an additional item (e.g., a $5 snack). It uses arithmetic operators (`+` for addition, `-` for subtraction), comparison operators (`<=` for budget checking, `>=` for remaining budget), and logical operators (`and` to combine conditions). The solution is designed to be beginner-friendly, reinforcing concepts from the Python Operators lesson while encouraging exploration of user input (as suggested in the project brief). Below is the solution with a step-by-step explanation.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Define Variables**: Create variables for three item prices (e.g., `item1_price = 30`, `item2_price = 20`, `item3_price = 15`) and a weekly budget (e.g., `budget = 100`).
2. **Calculate Total Cost**: Use the `+` operator to sum the prices of the three items.
3. **Check if Within Budget**: Use the `<=` operator to determine if the total cost is less than or equal to the budget.
4. **Calculate Remaining Budget**: Use the `-` operator to find how much money is left after subtracting the total cost from the budget.
5. **Check for Extra Item**: Use the `and` operator to check if the remaining budget is enough for a $5 snack and if the total is within budget.
6. **Print Results**: Display the total cost, whether it’s within budget, the remaining budget, and whether the extra item can be afforded.

This solution combines operators in a practical way, simulating a real-world budgeting scenario. While the project brief suggests exploring `input()` for user-entered prices, this solution sticks to static values to focus strictly on the operators covered in the lesson, keeping it accessible for beginners.

## Solution Code

```python
# Step 1: Define item prices and budget
item1_price = 30
item2_price = 20
item3_price = 15
budget = 100
extra_item_price = 5

# Step 2: Calculate total cost
total_cost = item1_price + item2_price + item3_price

# Step 3: Check if total is within budget
within_budget = total_cost <= budget

# Step 4: Calculate remaining budget
remaining_budget = budget - total_cost

# Step 5: Check if extra item can be afforded
can_afford_extra = remaining_budget >= extra_item_price and within_budget

# Step 6: Print results
print("Total cost of items: $", total_cost)
print("Is the total within budget ($", budget, ")?", within_budget)
print("Remaining budget: $", remaining_budget)
if can_afford_extra:
    print("You can afford a $", extra_item_price, "snack!")
else:
    print("You cannot afford a $", extra_item_price, "snack.")
```

## Output Explanation
When you run the code:
- `total_cost` is `30 + 20 + 15 = 65`.
- `within_budget` checks if `65 <= 100`, which is `True`.
- `remaining_budget` is `100 - 65 = 35`.
- `can_afford_extra` checks if `35 >= 5 and True`, which is `True`.
- The output will be:
  ```
  Total cost of items: $ 65
  Is the total within budget ($ 100 )? True
  Remaining budget: $ 35
  You can afford a $ 5 snack!
  ```

If you change the item prices (e.g., `item1_price = 50`, `item2_price = 40`, `item3_price = 20`), the total becomes `110`, which exceeds the budget, so `within_budget` becomes `False`, and `can_afford_extra` will also be `False` because of the `and` condition. The output would reflect that the budget is exceeded and the snack cannot be afforded.

## Notes for Beginners
- The program uses only the operators from the lesson (`+`, `-`, `<=`, `>=`, `and`), ensuring it aligns with your current knowledge.
- The `if` statement in the print section introduces a small preview of conditional logic, which is intuitive and builds confidence for future lessons.
- To explore the suggested `input()` function, you could modify the code to let users enter prices dynamically, but this would require converting string inputs to numbers (a concept for a future lesson).

This solution reinforces operator usage in a practical, real-world context while keeping the code simple and encouraging curiosity about extending the program.
