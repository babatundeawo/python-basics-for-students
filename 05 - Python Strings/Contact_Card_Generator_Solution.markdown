# Solution to Simple Contact Card Generator Project

This document provides the solution to the **Simple Contact Card Generator** project from the Python Strings lesson. The project involves creating a program that generates a formatted contact card based on user input for their name, email, and bio. It uses string methods, concatenation, f-strings, and checks the bio length, ensuring the output is neat and beginner-friendly. Below is the explanation and the complete solution.

## Explanation

The project requires a program that:
1. Collects the user’s full name, email address, and a short bio using `input()`.
2. Applies string methods:
   - Converts the name to title case using `title()`.
   - Removes extra whitespace from the email using `strip()`.
   - Checks the bio’s length using `len()` and slices it to 50 characters if it exceeds this limit.
3. Creates a formatted contact card using an f-string to combine the name, email, and bio.
4. Concatenates a header ("=== Contact Card ===") and a footer ("=== End ===") to the output.
5. Prints the contact card and the bio’s length.
6. Encourages exploration of additional string methods and hints at handling multiple contacts (a future topic like lists).

### Step-by-Step Breakdown
- **Step 1: Collect User Input**
  - Use `input()` to prompt the user for their full name, email, and bio.
  - Store the inputs in variables (`name`, `email`, `bio`).
- **Step 2: Process the Inputs**
  - Convert the `name` to title case using `title()` to ensure proper capitalization (e.g., "john doe" becomes "John Doe").
  - Remove leading/trailing whitespace from `email` using `strip()` to clean up the input.
  - Check the length of `bio` using `len()`. If it’s longer than 50 characters, slice it to the first 50 characters using `bio[:50]`.
- **Step 3: Create the Contact Card**
  - Use an f-string to format the contact card, including the processed `name`, `email`, and `bio`.
  - Concatenate the header and footer using the `+` operator or newlines (`\n`) for a clean layout.
- **Step 4: Output the Results**
  - Print the formatted contact card.
  - Print the bio’s length using an f-string (e.g., "Bio length: 39 characters").
- **Step 5: Exploration Prompt**
  - Encourage experimenting with other string methods like `upper()` or `replace()` to customize the card.
  - Pose a question about handling multiple contacts to spark curiosity about lists (a future topic).

### Key Concepts Used
- **Input**: `input()` to collect user data.
- **String Methods**:
  - `title()`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the name.
  - `strip()`: Removes whitespace from the email.
  - `len()`: Checks the bio’s length.
  - String slicing (`bio[:50]`): Limits the bio to 50 characters.
- **F-Strings**: For formatting the contact card with variables.
- **String Concatenation**: To add the header and footer.
- **Conditional Statements**: To check if the bio exceeds 50 characters.

This solution is designed to be simple, practical, and confidence-building, using only the string concepts from the lesson while encouraging creativity.

## Solution Code

```python
# Collect user input for name, email, and bio
name = input("Enter your full name: ")
email = input("Enter your email: ")
bio = input("Enter your bio: ")

# Process the inputs
name = name.title()  # Convert name to title case
email = email.strip()  # Remove leading/trailing whitespace from email
bio_length = len(bio)  # Get the length of the bio
if bio_length > 50:
    bio = bio[:50]  # Slice bio to first 50 characters if too long

# Create the contact card using an f-string
card = f"=== Contact Card ===\n"
card += f"Name: {name}\n"
card += f"Email: {email}\n"
card += f"Bio: {bio}\n"
card += f"Bio length: {bio_length} characters\n"
card += f"=== End ==="

# Print the contact card
print(card)
```

### Example Output
**Input**:
```
Enter your full name: john doe
Enter your email:  johndoe@example.com 
Enter your bio: I love coding and hiking in the mountains.
```

**Output**:
```
=== Contact Card ===
Name: John Doe
Email: johndoe@example.com
Bio: I love coding and hiking in the mountains.
Bio length: 39 characters
=== End ===
```

**Input (with long bio)**:
```
Enter your full name: alice smith
Enter your email: alice.smith@email.com
Enter your bio: I enjoy coding, hiking, reading books, and traveling the world to explore new cultures.
```

**Output**:
```
=== Contact Card ===
Name: Alice Smith
Email: alice.smith@email.com
Bio: I enjoy coding, hiking, reading books, and traveling
Bio length: 79 characters
=== End ===
```

### Notes
- The solution assumes basic familiarity with `input()` and `if` statements, as implied by the lesson’s context and exercise guidelines.
- The `title()` method ensures consistent name formatting (e.g., "john doe" becomes "John Doe").
- The `strip()` method cleans up email inputs with accidental spaces (e.g., "  johndoe@example.com " becomes "johndoe@example.com").
- If the bio exceeds 50 characters, it’s truncated to 50 characters using slicing (`bio[:50]`), but the original `bio_length` is reported to show the full length.
- The output is formatted with newlines (`\n`) for readability, and the header/footer are concatenated to frame the card.
- **Exploration Ideas**:
  - Try using `upper()` to make the name stand out or `replace()` to add a custom touch (e.g., replace "coding" with "programming" in the bio).
  - Consider how you might store multiple contact cards (hinting at lists, a future topic).
- Test the program with various inputs, such as short/long bios, names with mixed case, and emails with extra spaces, to ensure robustness.

This solution reinforces string manipulation skills, encourages creative formatting, and prepares students for future concepts like lists, all while keeping the task engaging and achievable for beginners.
