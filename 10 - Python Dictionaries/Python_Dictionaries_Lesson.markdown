## Section 1 – Explanations

Dictionaries in Python are used to store data in **key:value** pairs, making them ideal for associating unique keys with specific values. They are **ordered** (as of Python 3.7, meaning items maintain their insertion order), **changeable** (you can modify, add, or remove items), and **do not allow duplicate keys** (if a key is repeated, the last value overwrites earlier ones). Dictionaries are written using **curly brackets `{}`**, with keys and values separated by colons.

### Key Concepts from the Lesson:
1. **Creating a Dictionary**:
   - A dictionary is created with curly brackets or the `dict()` constructor.
   - Example from the lesson:
     ```python
     thisdict = {
       "brand": "Ford",
       "model": "Mustang",
       "year": 1964
     }
     print(thisdict)  # Output: {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 1964}
     ```
   - Using the `dict()` constructor:
     ```python
     thisdict = dict(name="John", age=36, country="Norway")
     print(thisdict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 36, 'country': 'Norway'}
     ```

2. **Accessing Items**:
   - Access values using the key in square brackets (`dict[key]`) or the `get()` method.
   - Example:
     ```python
     print(thisdict["model"])  # Output: Mustang
     print(thisdict.get("model"))  # Output: Mustang
     ```

3. **Dictionary Methods**:
   - `keys()`: Returns a view of all keys.
   - `values()`: Returns a view of all values.
   - `items()`: Returns a view of key:value pairs as tuples.
   - Example:
     ```python
     car = {"brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "year": 1964}
     print(car.keys())   # Output: dict_keys(['brand', 'model', 'year'])
     print(car.values()) # Output: dict_values(['Ford', 'Mustang', 1964])
     print(car.items())  # Output: dict_items([('brand', 'Ford'), ('model', 'Mustang'), ('year', 1964)])
     ```

4. **Modifying Dictionaries**:
   - Change a value using the key or the `update()` method.
   - Add items by assigning a new key or using `update()`.
   - Remove items with `pop()`, `popitem()`, `del`, or `clear()`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     thisdict["year"] = 2018  # Changes year to 2018
     thisdict.update({"color": "red"})  # Adds color
     thisdict.pop("model")  # Removes model
     print(thisdict)  # Output: {'brand': 'Ford', 'year': 2018, 'color': 'red'}
     ```

5. **Looping Through Dictionaries**:
   - Loop through keys, values, or both using `for` loops with `keys()`, `values()`, or `items()`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     for x, y in thisdict.items():
       print(x, y)  # Outputs each key and value pair
     ```

6. **Copying Dictionaries**:
   - Use `copy()` or `dict()` to create an independent copy, as direct assignment creates a reference.
   - Example:
     ```python
     mydict = thisdict.copy()
     ```

7. **Nested Dictionaries**:
   - Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries.
   - Example:
     ```python
     myfamily = {
       "child1": {"name": "Emil", "year": 2004},
       "child2": {"name": "Tobias", "year": 2007}
     }
     print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])  # Output: Tobias
     ```

8. **Other Features**:
   - Use `len()` to get the number of items.
   - Check if a key exists with the `in` keyword.
   - Values can be any data type (e.g., strings, numbers, lists, booleans).
   - Example:
     ```python
     print(len(thisdict))  # Outputs the number of key:value pairs
     if "model" in thisdict:
       print("Model exists!")
     ```

### Simple Example for Beginners:
```python
# A dictionary to store student information
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science"
}
print(student["name"])  # Output: Alice
student["grade"] = "A"  # Adding a new key:value pair
print(student)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 20, 'major': 'Computer Science', 'grade': 'A'}
```

## Section 2 – Class Exercise

### Exercise: Personal Profile Dictionary
**Problem**: You are creating a program to store information about a person, such as their name, age, and favorite hobby. The program should allow you to add a new piece of information (their city) and check if a specific key exists in the dictionary.

**Guidelines**:
1. Create a dictionary with the following key:value pairs:
   - `"name"`: A string (e.g., "Emma").
   - `"age"`: An integer (e.g., 25).
   - `"hobby"`: A string (e.g., "Reading").
2. Print the value of the `"name"` key using either square brackets or the `get()` method.
3. Add a new key `"city"` with a value (e.g., "New York") using either assignment or the `update()` method.
4. Check if the key `"hobby"` exists in the dictionary using the `in` keyword and print a message like "Hobby is included!" if it exists.
5. Print the entire dictionary to see the updated result.

**Tips**:
- Use the examples from the lesson to guide your syntax.
- Test your code to ensure each step works as expected.
- Experiment with both the square bracket and `get()` methods to access values.

## Section 3 – Weekly Project

### Project: Pet Store Inventory
**Project Brief**: You are building a program to manage a pet store’s inventory. The program will use a dictionary to store information about different pets, such as their type, name, and price. You’ll allow users to add a new pet, update prices, and display all pet details in a readable format. This project connects to the lesson’s concepts (creating, accessing, and modifying dictionaries) and encourages you to explore loops for displaying data, which ties into the lesson’s looping section.

**Guidelines**:
1. **Create a Dictionary**:
   - Create a dictionary called `pet_store` with at least three pets. Each pet should have:
     - A key (e.g., `"pet1"`, `"pet2"`) that maps to a nested dictionary.
     - The nested dictionary should contain `"type"` (e.g., "Dog"), `"name"` (e.g., "Buddy"), and `"price"` (e.g., 500).
   - Example structure:
     ```python
     pet_store = {
         "pet1": {"type": "Dog", "name": "Buddy", "price": 500},
         "pet2": {"type": "Cat", "name": "Whiskers", "price": 300}
     }
     ```

2. **Add a New Pet**:
   - Add a new pet to the dictionary using either assignment or the `update()` method. For example, add `"pet3"` with its own nested dictionary.

3. **Update a Price**:
   - Choose one pet and update its price (e.g., increase the price of `"pet1"` by 50). Use either direct assignment or the `update()` method.

4. **Display All Pets**:
   - Use a `for` loop with the `items()` method to loop through the dictionary and print each pet’s details in a readable format, such as:
     ```
     Pet 1: Type = Dog, Name = Buddy, Price = 500
     Pet 2: Type = Cat, Name = Whiskers, Price = 300
     ```

5. **Challenge (Curiosity Spark)**:
   - Try checking if a specific pet type (e.g., "Dog") exists in the inventory by looping through the dictionary and checking the `"type"` key in each nested dictionary. Print a message like "We have a Dog in stock!" if found.
   - This encourages you to explore nested dictionary access and loops, preparing you for more advanced dictionary operations in future lessons.

**Tips**:
- Start by creating the dictionary and testing each step (adding, updating, looping).
- Use the lesson’s nested dictionary examples to guide your structure.
- For the challenge, think about how you can access values in a nested dictionary within a loop.
- Keep your code simple and test it frequently to ensure it works as expected.

This project allows you to practice creating, modifying, and looping through dictionaries while applying them to a real-world scenario, fostering both understanding and creativity.
