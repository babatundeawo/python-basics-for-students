# Solution to Weekly Project: Personal Greeting Generator

This document provides a sample solution to the weekly project described in the Python Syntax lesson. The project involves creating a Python program named `personal_greeting.py` that asks the user for their name, stores it in a variable, uses an `if` statement to print a personalized greeting based on the name’s length, and includes comments to explain the code. The solution is beginner-friendly, adheres to the guidelines, and incorporates the optional `else` block for a complete implementation without excessive complexity.

## Sample Solution

Below is a Python program that meets the project requirements. It uses the `input()` function, proper indentation, a multiline comment, a single-line comment, and an `if-else` statement to generate greetings based on the name’s length.

```python
"""
This program asks the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting
based on whether the name is longer than 5 characters.
"""
name = input("Enter your name: ")  # Get the user's name
name_length = len(name)  # Store the length of the name

if name_length > 5:  # Check if the name is longer than 5 characters
    # Print greeting for long names
    print(f"Hello {name}, you have a long name!")
else:  # For names 5 characters or fewer
    print(f"Hello {name}, short and sweet!")
```

### Explanation of the Solution
- **Multiline Comment**: The `"""` block at the top describes the program’s purpose.
- **Variable for Name**: `name = input("Enter your name: ")` prompts the user for input and stores it in the `name` variable.
- **Variable for Name Length**: `name_length = len(name)` calculates and stores the length of the input string.
- **If-Else Statement**: 
  - The condition `if name_length > 5:` checks if the name’s length exceeds 5 characters.
  - If true, the program prints a greeting for long names using an f-string: `print(f"Hello {name}, you have a long name!")`.
  - If false, the `else` block prints a greeting for shorter names: `print(f"Hello {name}, short and sweet!")`.
- **Indentation**: All statements within the `if` and `else` blocks are indented with 4 spaces, following Python’s syntax rules.
- **Single-Line Comment**: The line `# Print greeting for long names` inside the `if` block explains the action.
- **Running the Program**: Save this code in a file named `personal_greeting.py` and run it with `python personal_greeting.py`. For example:
  - Input `Alexander` (9 characters) outputs: `Hello Alexander, you have a long name!`
  - Input `Emma` (4 characters) outputs: `Hello Emma, short and sweet!`

### Testing Variations
To complete the project, test the program with different names (e.g., `John`, `Elizabeth`, `Bob`, `Christopher`) to verify that it correctly distinguishes between names longer than 5 characters and those 5 characters or fewer. Ensure the indentation is consistent and there are no syntax errors.
