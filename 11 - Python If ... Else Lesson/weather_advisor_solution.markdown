# Solution to Simple Weather Advisor Project

## Explanation

The project requires a Python program that advises users on what to wear based on the weather, using two inputs: temperature (in Celsius) and whether it’s raining ("yes" or "no"). The rules are:
- Temperature below 10°C: Suggest a "heavy jacket".
- Temperature 10–20°C: Suggest a "light jacket".
- Temperature above 20°C: Suggest a "t-shirt".
- If raining, add "and bring an umbrella" to the suggestion.

The program uses `input()` to collect the temperature and rain status, converts the temperature to an integer with `int()`, and uses `if-elif-else` statements to evaluate the temperature ranges. The `and` logical operator checks the rain status to append the umbrella suggestion. A `try-except` block is included for error handling (e.g., non-numeric temperature inputs) to make the program practical, though this slightly extends beyond the lesson’s scope. The explanation focuses on the lesson’s concepts: `if-elif-else`, comparison operators (`<`, `>`), logical operators (`and`), and input handling.

The solution uses `if-elif-else` for simplicity, as it’s more beginner-friendly than the `match` statement, but both could work. The program combines conditions to produce a clear outfit suggestion, fulfilling the project’s real-world scenario.

### Solution Code

```python
temperature = input("Enter the temperature (in Celsius): ")
raining = input("Is it raining? (yes/no): ")

try:
    temperature = int(temperature)
    suggestion = ""

    if temperature < 10:
        suggestion = "Wear a heavy jacket"
    elif temperature >= 10 and temperature <= 20:
        suggestion = "Wear a light jacket"
    else:
        suggestion = "Wear a t-shirt"

    if raining.lower() == "yes":
        suggestion += " and bring an umbrella"

    print(suggestion)
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number for temperature.")
```

### How It Works
1. **Inputs**:
   - The program prompts for temperature and stores it as a string in `temperature`.
   - It prompts for rain status ("yes" or "no") and stores it in `raining`.
2. **Conversion**:
   - Inside a `try` block, `temperature` is converted to an integer using `int(temperature)`.
   - If the input isn’t a valid number, the `except` block catches the `ValueError` and prints an error message.
3. **Temperature Check**:
   - `if temperature < 10`: Sets `suggestion` to "Wear a heavy jacket".
   - `elif temperature >= 10 and temperature <= 20`: Sets `suggestion` to "Wear a light jacket".
   - `else`: Sets `suggestion` to "Wear a t-shirt" (for temperature > 20).
4. **Rain Check**:
   - The `if raining.lower() == "yes"` checks if the user entered "yes" (case-insensitive, using `.lower()`).
   - If true, it appends " and bring an umbrella" to `suggestion`.
5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final `suggestion`.

### Example Runs
- **Input**: Temperature = `5`, Raining = `yes` → **Output**: `Wear a heavy jacket and bring an umbrella`
- **Input**: Temperature = `15`, Raining = `no` → **Output**: `Wear a light jacket`
- **Input**: Temperature = `25`, Raining = `yes` → **Output**: `Wear a t-shirt and bring an umbrella`
- **Input**: Temperature = `abc`, Raining = `no` → **Output**: `Please enter a valid number for temperature.`

### Connection to Lesson
The solution uses `if-elif-else` to handle temperature ranges, comparison operators (`<`, `>=`, `<=`), and the `and` logical operator for the temperature range check. The rain status check uses `==` for string comparison. The `try-except` block introduces basic error handling, aligning with the project’s suggestion to explore input validation, which builds curiosity for future lessons. The program is simple, practical, and directly applies the lesson’s concepts to a real-world scenario.
