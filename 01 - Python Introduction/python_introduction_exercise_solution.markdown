# Solution to Class Exercise: Write and Run Your First Python Program

The exercise asked you to write a Python program that uses the `print()` function to display your name on the screen. Below is a solution to guide beginners through completing this task.

## Solution Code
```python
print("Your Name")
```
- Replace `"Your Name"` with your actual name, for example, `"Alice"` or `"John"`.
- Save this code in a file named `my_program.py` (or any name with a `.py` extension).
- Run the program using a Python interpreter or an IDE like Thonny.
- **Expected Output**: Your name will appear on the screen, e.g., `Alice` if you used `print("Alice")`.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Open a Text Editor or IDE**: Use a simple text editor like Notepad or an IDE like Thonny to write your code.
2. **Write the Code**: Type the `print()` function with your name in quotation marks inside the parentheses.
3. **Save the File**: Save the file with a `.py` extension to indicate it’s a Python file.
4. **Run the Program**: Use a Python interpreter (e.g., running `python my_program.py` in a terminal) or the "Run" button in an IDE.
5. **Check the Output**: Ensure the output matches your name. If it doesn’t, check for typos or incorrect syntax.

**Note**: This is a basic solution for beginners. Ensure there are no extra symbols (like semicolons) and that the code is written on a single line, as Python uses new lines to separate commands.
