# Answers to Weekly Project: Create a Greeting Program

**Objective**: Write a Python program that prints a personalized greeting message.

**Guidelines and Answers**:

1. **Create a new file in a text editor and name it `greeting.py`.**  
   - *Answer*: Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, or Thonny) and create a new file. Save it as `greeting.py` (ensure the `.py` extension is included) in a folder you can easily access, such as `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Python` on Windows or `~/Documents/Python` on Linux/Mac.

2. **Use the `print()` function to display a greeting**, such as "Hello, [Your Name]! Welcome to Python programming!"  
   - *Answer*: For example, if your name is "Sam," write the following code in `greeting.py`:  
     ```python
     print("Hello, Sam! Welcome to Python programming!")
     ```

3. **Save the file in a folder you can access.**  
   - *Answer*: Save `greeting.py` in a folder like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Python` (Windows) or `~/Documents/Python` (Linux/Mac). Double-check that the file has the `.py` extension.

4. **Open your command line or terminal, navigate to the folder, and run the program with `python greeting.py`.**  
   - *Answer*: Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux/Mac) and navigate to the folder using:  
     - Windows: `cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Python`  
     - Linux/Mac: `cd ~/Documents/Python`  
     Then, run the program by typing:  
     ```
     python greeting.py
     ```

5. **Experiment by modifying the message** (e.g., change the greeting or add more lines using additional `print()` statements).  
   - *Answer*: You can modify the message or add more lines. For example:  
     ```python
     print("Hello, Sam! Welcome to Python programming!")
     print("I'm excited to learn coding!")
     ```  
     This will output:  
     ```
     Hello, Sam! Welcome to Python programming!
     I'm excited to learn coding!
     ```

6. **Test your program** to ensure it outputs the greeting correctly.  
   - *Answer*: After running `python greeting.py`, the output should match your `print()` statements. For the example above, it would be:  
     ```
     Hello, Sam! Welcome to Python programming!
     I'm excited to learn coding!
     ```  
     If there’s no output or an error, check:  
     - The file is saved as `greeting.py` with the correct extension.  
     - You’re in the correct directory in the command line/terminal.  
     - Python is installed (run `python --version` to verify; download from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/) if needed).

**Tips**:  
- Keep the message simple, using text inside quotation marks in the `print()` function.  
- For creativity, you can add multiple `print()` statements, such as a greeting followed by a fun fact. Example:  
  ```python
  print("Hello, Sam! Welcome to Python programming!")
  print("Fun fact: I love solving puzzles!")
  ```  
- If errors occur, ensure Python is installed and the file path is correct.

**Expected Outcome**: The program should print your personalized greeting. For example:  
```
Hello, Sam! Welcome to Python programming!
```
