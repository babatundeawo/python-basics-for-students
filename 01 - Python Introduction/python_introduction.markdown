# Python Introduction

## What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is used for:

- Web development (server-side)
- Software development
- Mathematics
- System scripting

## What can Python do?
Python can:
- Create web applications on a server
- Work alongside software to create workflows
- Connect to database systems and handle file operations (e.g., reading or modifying files)
- Manage big data and perform complex mathematics
- Support rapid prototyping or production-ready software development

## Why Python?
Python is favored because:
- It works on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- It has a simple, English-like syntax
- It requires fewer lines of code compared to other languages
- It is interpreted, allowing code to run immediately, which speeds up prototyping
- It supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles

## Good to Know
- This tutorial uses **Python 3**, the latest major version
- Python code can be written in a text editor or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Thonny, PyCharm, Netbeans, or Eclipse, which are useful for larger projects

## Python Syntax Compared to Other Programming Languages
- Python is designed for readability, with a syntax influenced by English and mathematics
- It uses **new lines** to complete commands, unlike other languages that use semicolons or parentheses
- It relies on **indentation** (whitespace) to define scope (e.g., for loops, functions, classes), while other languages often use curly braces `{}`

### Example
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Python Getting Started

### Python Install
Many PCs and Macs have Python pre-installed. To check if Python is installed:
- **Windows**: Search for Python in the start bar or run in Command Prompt:
  ```
  C:\Users\Your Name>python --version
  ```
- **Linux/Mac**: Open Terminal and type:
  ```
  python --version
  ```
If Python is not installed, download it for free from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).

### Python Quickstart
Python is an interpreted language, meaning you write `.py` files in a text editor and run them using the Python interpreter.

#### Example: First Python File
Create a file named `hello.py` in a text editor:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Save the file, navigate to its directory in the command line, and run:
```
C:\Users\Your Name>python hello.py
```
**Output**:
```
Hello, World!
```
Congratulations, youâ€™ve written and executed your first Python program!
